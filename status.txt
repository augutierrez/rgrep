Matcher.c was made for rgrep.
The following operators are supported:
+ : I implemented this by using the helper function plus_operator
. : I implemented this by using the helper functions period_operator and isEmpty
\ : I implemented this within matches_leading
? : I implemented this within matches_leading
Everything works as expected!
